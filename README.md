# Merge-Excel-files

ADD THE CODE TO EXCEL
The easiest way to do this is to open a blank workbook and insert this into a VB module
  Insert VBA code to Excel Workbook.
    Open your workbook in Excel.
    Press Alt + F11 to open Visual Basic Editor (VBE).
    Right-click on your workbook name in the " Project-VBAProject " pane (at the top left corner of the editor window) and select Insert -> Module from ...
    Copy the VBA code (use one of these three suggestions) and paste it to the right pane of the VBA editor (" Module1 " window).
    The code now exists in that file.
   
ADD YOUR FILES TO THE DIRECTORY AND EDIT THE MACRO WITH THIS INFORMATION
Now copy your files in the directory - I'd suggest creating a whole new directory with copies of the files to be merged. Edit the code to update the 
directories you will find it in the section with C:\insert\path\here

RUN YOUR MACRO

On the Developer tab, in the Code group, click Macros. 
  If you don't see this group you need to go into File -->Options -->Advanced-->on the right side of the screen, click on the developer box
In the Macro name box, click the macro that you want to run, and press the Run button.

SIT BACK AND WATCH

Depending on the number of files, this might take some time. maybe one or two seconds per file.
